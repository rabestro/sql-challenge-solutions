# SQL-Challenge-Solutions

This repository is a comprehensive collection of my solutions to various SQL challenges and exercises sourced from multiple courses and platforms, including "Level Up: Advanced SQL", "SQL Essential Training", and HackerRank, among others. The aim is to document my journey in enhancing my SQL skills and to provide a resource for others looking to improve their database querying capabilities.

## Featured Courses and Platforms

- [Level Up: Advanced SQL](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/level-up-advanced-sql)
- [SQL Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/sql-essential-training-20685933)
- [HackerRank SQL Challenges](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql)

More solutions will be added as I continue to explore and learn from different sources.

## How to Use

Each folder within this repository is dedicated to a specific course or platform. Inside, you'll find SQL scripts or files named according to the challenge or exercise they solve. To run these solutions, ensure you have a SQL database environment compatible with the syntax used in the scripts (primarily SQLite for course-related solutions).

## Technologies Used

- SQL
- SQLite
