# Solutions to Level Up: Advanced SQL

This repository contains my solutions to the [Level Up: Advanced SQL](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/level-up-advanced-sql) course on LinkedIn Learning. The course, led by Jess Pomfret, covers advanced SQL techniques including complex joins, window functions, and more.

## Course Link

You can find the course here: [Level Up: Advanced SQL](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/level-up-advanced-sql)

## Course Materials and Database Creation

The SQL scripts to create the database used in this course can be found at the official GitHub repository: [Level Up: Advanced SQL Course Materials](https://github.com/LinkedInLearning/level-up-advanced-sql-4311094).

## ER Diagram

I've created an ER diagram to visualize the database structure, which can be found in this repository under [database.mermaid](database.mermaid). This diagram helps in understanding the relationships between the tables used in the SQL exercises.

## How to Use

To use these solutions, you'll need a SQL database environment that supports SQLite syntax. Each file corresponds to a challenge or exercise from the course. Simply run the SQL script in your preferred database management tool to see the solution in action.

## Technologies Used

- SQL
- SQLite (as used in the course examples)
