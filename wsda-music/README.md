# SQL Essential Training Solutions

## Description

This repository contains my solutions to the "SQL Essential Training" course, available at [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/sql-essential-training-20685933). This course is designed to equip learners with the skills necessary to navigate, understand, and manipulate data within relational databases using SQL. It covers the basics of databases, SQL syntax, and advanced data retrieval techniques, making it ideal for data analysts and application developers looking to enhance their proficiency in handling big data.

Walter Shields, the instructor, guides through the fundamental structure of databases, the execution of SQL queries to retrieve data efficiently, and the application of SQL syntax in various scenarios. The course also includes Code Challenges powered by CoderPad, offering interactive coding exercises with real-time feedback to reinforce learning and skill development.

## Learning Objectives

- Define and describe the function of relational databases, SQL, and DB Browser.
- Explain how to run DB Browser and write rudimentary queries.
- Illustrate the use of `WHERE` clauses to filter data.
- Explain the application of inner, left, and right `JOIN` clauses.
- Show how to organize results by group.
- Explain the formulation and use of aggregate queries.
- Demonstrate the utility and implementation of views for data analysis.

## Installation

Follow the installation and setup instructions provided in the course to prepare your environment. Ensure SQLite is installed on your system as it is the database used for these exercises. The database file is included in the repository.

## Usage

To use these solutions:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure SQLite is installed and properly set up as described in the course.
3. Open the SQL files in your preferred database management tool or execute them using SQLite command line.
4. The solutions are organized by challenge number, e.g., `challenge-3.sql`, `challenge-4.sql`, etc.

## Schema

The database schema used for these exercises is defined in the [`database.mermaid`](database.mermaid) file. It visualizes the structure of the database, including tables and relationships.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit pull requests with improvements or corrections to the SQL queries.
